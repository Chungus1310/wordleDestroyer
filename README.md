## 🌟 What is This?

Chun's Wordle Destroyer is a sophisticated Wordle solving tool that uses advanced entropy-based algorithms to suggest the mathematically optimal next word. With a sleek dark UI and access to a comprehensive almost 15,000 word database, this tool helps you dominate Wordle puzzles with precision and style.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Smart Algorithm
- **Entropy-based word selection** - Chooses words that provide maximum information gain
- **Real-time filtering** - Instantly narrows down possibilities based on your feedback
- **Multiple suggestions** - Get up to 10 alternative optimal words when the primary suggestion isn't accepted
- **Performance optimized** - Handles massive word lists without breaking a sweat

### 🎨 Beautiful Interface
- **Dark theme** - Easy on the eyes during long solving sessions
- **Smooth animations** - Every interaction feels premium and responsive
- **Mobile-friendly** - Works perfectly on any device
- **Intuitive controls** - Click letters to cycle through colors just like Wordle

### 📊 Live Statistics
- **Remaining possibilities** - See how many words are still viable
- **Entropy scores** - Understand the mathematical strength of each suggestion
- **Attempt tracking** - Monitor your progress through the puzzle

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Enter Your Word
Type your starting word (we recommend "CRANE" for optimal results) and click **ADD WORD**.

### Step 2: Set the Colors
Click each letter to cycle through the colors based on Wordle's feedback:
- **Black** - Letter not in the target word
- **Yellow** - Letter in word but wrong position  
- **Green** - Letter in correct position

### Step 3: Get Your Next Move
Click **GET SUGGESTION** to receive the mathematically optimal next word. If that word isn't accepted by Wordle, use **NEXT OPTION** to cycle through alternatives.

### Step 4: Repeat Until Victory
Continue this process until you've conquered the puzzle!

## 🎯 Why This Works

The algorithm uses **entropy maximization** to select words that eliminate the maximum number of possibilities with each guess. This isn't random guessing - it's mathematical precision that consistently solves Wordles in 3-4 attempts.

### Key Algorithmic Features:
- **Pattern matching engine** - Perfectly filters possibilities based on color feedback
- **Entropy calculation** - Ranks words by their information-gathering potential
- **Smart candidate selection** - Optimizes performance even with large word sets
- **Multiple fallback options** - Always have backup words ready

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - No dependencies, runs anywhere
- **15,000+ word database** - Comprehensive English word coverage
- **Responsive design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Modern UI** - Built with CSS Grid, Flexbox, and smooth animations

## 🏆 Pro Tips

1. **Start with CRANE** - Statistically proven to be one of the best opening words
2. **Use all suggestions** - If the primary word isn't accepted, try the alternatives
3. **Pay attention to entropy** - Higher entropy scores mean better information gain
4. **Trust the math** - The algorithm knows what it's doing!
